## Running the project

- Install PHP (make sure you have PHP 8 or above by running `php -v`)
- Run `php -S localhost:8080` from the root folder. You can pick any port instead of 8080 if needed.

## Creating a new page

Create a folder for each prototype and use `template_for_new_pages.php` as the starting point for new pages

## Using SASS

- Install SASS globally by running `npm install -g sass`.
- To watch and build the SASS, run `sass --watch sass/etna.scss:css/dist/etna.css`
- To modify styles, navigate to the `sass` folder in your editor.
