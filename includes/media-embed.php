            Discover what it was like to wander the streets of Shakespeare’s London. Though large portions of the city from Shakespeare’s time
            have since been destroyed by fire, war and developers, a surprising number of buildings and places still survive. Author David Thomas
            discusses the sights, cuisine and pastimes of 16th century Londoners, while providing insight into what it was like to be a tourist during
            Shakespeare’s lifetime. Please note that there are occasional disruptions to the sound quality during this recording.
