It is thought he married his wife, Anne Hathaway, in 1582, although we have no specific marriage certificate. He pursued a career as an actor, poet and dramatist in London.",

The first folio was published in 1623, with 154 sonnets, 37 plays, and 2 long poems. It is suggested that his friends put it together in case others tried to copy Shakespeare’s work and claim it as their own.",
